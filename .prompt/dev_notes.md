## Reflection
Using AI tools like GitHub Copilot significantly streamlined the development process. The AI provided a solid foundation for the project, saving time on repetitive tasks like setting up the HTML structure and CSS. However, I had to review and tweak the output to ensure it met the assignment requirements and my personal preferences. For example, I adjusted the CSS to improve responsiveness and added alt text for images to enhance accessibility. Additionally, while the AI-generated contact form was functional, I refined the JavaScript to ensure better error handling. This experience highlighted the importance of balancing AI assistance with personal oversight to produce high-quality work. Overall, AI was a valuable partner in this project, but critical thinking and manual adjustments were essential to achieve the desired outcome.
