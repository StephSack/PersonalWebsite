## Reflection

Using AI tools like GitHub Copilot significantly streamlined the development process for this project. AI was particularly helpful in generating the initial structure for the website, including HTML and CSS, which saved a lot of time on repetitive tasks. For example, creating the navigation bar and ensuring consistent styling across pages were tasks that AI handled efficiently. Additionally, AI provided valuable assistance in implementing form validation and accessibility features, such as connecting labels to inputs and adding validation attributes.

However, there were instances where AI made mistakes or required adjustments. For example, the `pattern` attribute in the form was redundant, and I had to refine the JavaScript for better error handling. Similarly, layout adjustments for images and text often required manual intervention to meet specific design requirements.

Balancing AI assistance with personal oversight was key. While AI provided a strong foundation, critical thinking and manual refinements ensured the final product met the desired quality and functionality.
